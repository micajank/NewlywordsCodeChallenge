# NewlywordsCodeChallenge
For the modal challenge, I created a simple node project using express to serve on localhost:3000, and vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS on the front-end.


## Download instructions
1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. git clone into a directory of your choosing
3. cd into project
4. 'npm i' (to grab the dependencies from the package.json file)
5. run 'node index.js' to run the server
6. navigate to localhost:3000 

#### Steps
1. I began by opening a new directory, git init, and touching any necessary folders and files. 
2. I then wrote my basic boilerplate for both the index.html as well as the index.js
3. Once I have both the modal open button and modal itself served onto the browser, I started using the DOM to manipulate the button modal to switch their displays to show one or the other.
4. I did some basic CSS to get things positioned and generally in the correct area
5. Finally I did some searching for correct fonts and colors to match the mockup as well as possible.

Overall, the initialization of files, functionality and basic styling took my about 20-25 minutes, altho I spent another 30 or so minutes stwitching back and forth between my version and the mockup making tiny adjustments to get all the small details right.
